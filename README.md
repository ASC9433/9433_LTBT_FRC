# FIRST Robotics Competition Code base for Lil' Timmy's Big Team

## Getting started:
- Install the wplib VS code plug in
- git clone this reporitory through the plug in
- refresh C++ intellisense
- intall wplib tools
- install g++
- gradle build
- done.
- (note these steps are just a reminder for how I got everything working, will make a more detialed version later)

## How to not get in code dept:
1. Save often
2. Make a new branch when making large changes.
3. Commit even more often in said new branch.
4. Build often.
5. Be patient, a well implemented solution is allways better than a hacked together one. (Trust me, this is from personal experience)
