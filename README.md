## How to not get in code dept:
1. Save often
2. Make a new branch when making large changes.
3. Commit even more often in said new branch.
4. Build often.
5. Be patient, a well implemented solution is always better than a hacked together one. (Trust me, this is from personal experience)
6. And finally, arguably the most important step of all, read the documentation when you get stuck or want to implement something new (as there's probably a library that already does it).

## Docs:
- [General FRC docs.](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) (Start here, but skip over java sections, unless you want to re-write in java, in which case good luck)
- [WPILib C++ docs.](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/index.html) (good for finding #includes for various functions/objects)
