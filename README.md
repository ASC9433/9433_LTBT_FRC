# FIRST Robotics Competition Code base for Lil' Timmy's Big Team

## Getting started:
- Install the wplib VS code plug in
- git clone this reporitory through the plug in
- refresh C++ intellisense
- intall wplib tools
- install g++
- gradle build
- done.
- (note these steps are just a reminder for how I got everything working, will make a more detialed version later)

## How to not get in code dept:
1. Save often
2. Make a new branch when making large changes.
3. Commit even more often in said new branch.
4. Build often.
5. Be patient, a well implemented solution is allways better than a hacked together one. (Trust me, this is from personal experience)
6. And finally, read the documentation when you get stuck.

## Docs:
- [General FRC docs.](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) (Start here, but skip over java sections, unless you want to re-write in java, in which case good luck)
- [WPlib C++ docs.](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/index.html) (good for finding #includes for various functions/objects)
